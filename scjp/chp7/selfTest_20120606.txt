ERRORS

1. B (C=> in List<List<Interger>> aa = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>(); is not valid because the parametrized type has t be the same, not the main class, remember that finally will be erased on runtime).
4. CD (If hashcode is not defined, every objects goes to its bucket, so 3 objects without hashcode always will be on three diff buckets => size = 3)
6. B. (D breacks because munch(Sheep) does not fulfills the contract of Carnivore)
7. C (List is an interface)
8. BEF (A: Return type is not declared as ArrayList, is List, you cannot assign to a subclass directly, can be another class)
11. A,D. (A ... hashCode is not properly implemented but automatically converting from double to int)
13. A.
15.G
16. D,G (D is not extrictly true ...)
